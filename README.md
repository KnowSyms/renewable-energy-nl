Renewable energy is energy from wind, hydro power, the sun, the earth, biomass and heat from outdoor air. This is energy from natural processes that is replenished constantly. Gross final consumption of energy is consumption of energy for energy-related purposes by the end-users without producing another usable energy commodity plus the use of electricity and heat for by electricity and heat producing companies plus the distribution losses for electricity and heat.

This RDF dataset contains definitive figures up to and including 2018 and revised provisional for 2019. Figures of 2020 are provisional only.


Final consumption values are provided in TJ - TeraJoule (joule is a unit of energy equivalent to 0.24 calories). Final relative consumption is the gross final consumption of renewable energy as percentage of total gross final energetic energy consumption, calculated according the definitions from the EU directive on renewable energy from 2009.
